# TimsFactory
Tim's factory is my first Fullstack project using SQL SERVER, C# and vanilla JS.
Tim's Factory is an online employee management system that implements CRUD actions.
The code has some obfuscation authentication that relies on local storage and server requests.  
Users are limited by the amount of actions they have per day and before each actions is committed a verification is checked. 

Had lots of fun making this project! But to be honest I'm a bit sick of finding elements by their ID... Hopefully next project will be using a Framework.
